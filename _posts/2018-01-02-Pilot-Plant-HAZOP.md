HAZOP analysis of vinyl chloride monomer pilot plant.

<!-- more -->

#### Project Aim

Perform a HAZOP analysis of a vinyl chloride monomer pilot plant. PI&D were provided to the team, as well as a map with distances to local facilities and sensitive areas.

#### Approach

Due to the group size and similar class schedule, brainstorming ideas in person is the best method to perform a HAZOP. Google Sheets was used to allow team members to fill in details and calculations after meetings.

From commonly known deviations (low/high temperature, low/high levels, low/high pressure, low/high flow, incorrect material, and human error), causes, consequences, and enabling events were listed out.

For consequences with high environmental, economical, or health factors, caluclations were done to determine frequency of failure and a risk ranking was assigned.

Safety recommendations and expected cost benefits of recommendation were developed for the highest risk. Management of Change documenations highlighted what changes may require a partial or full review of the pilot plant.
