Solutions sets to numerical method programming.

<!-- more -->

In a similar vein to the C problem set solutions for APS106, these solutions are written in Fortran with MATLAB. Again, these are purely for maintaining a schedule of git commits.

Source code for the project is available on github: [https://github.com/NanoSmasher/Problem-Set-Solutions-for-MSE238](https://github.com/NanoSmasher/Problem-Set-Solutions-for-MSE238)
