Modeling Steak cooking times

<!-- more -->

In the cooking industry, cooking meat is largely based on experience; time required to cook meat to a desired degree is usually approximated due to many complications encountered during its cooking. These problems can come from cooking technique, ingredients involved, and variability in cooking equipment. As such, internal temperature must be measured either very frequently or with an expensive in-situ thermometer. An idealized method to estimate the required amount of time for a steak to reach a desired internal temperature would eliminate many uncertainties, and would only require measurement towards the end of the cooking process. Therefore the objective of this project is to estimate the required time to cook a steak to a certain "degree" (Medium-Rare, Medium, and Well Done).
