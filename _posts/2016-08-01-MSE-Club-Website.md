MSE Club website for the materials engineering discipline students.

<!-- more -->

### Project Aim

Website used to promote events and activites to other students in the MSE discipline.

### Approach

Jekyll was chosen for the following reasons:

* Successful implementation of Jekyll with other clubs using the \*.skule.ca domain
* Static website minimizes complexity when transitioning between club webmasters
* The club does not have a large amount of data to serve, administrative information is handled internally.

### Results

While word of mouth promoted events and activities more than the website, there were positive comments about the website from the general discipline.

Website was turned over to another developer on September 2017.

Visit the website at [mse.skule.ca](https://mse.skule.ca)
