Improvement to End of Life Service

<!-- more -->

The strategies and practice course aims to have groups of engineering students connect with a real client and help solve their problem. From the client statement, a rigourous methodology is used to ensure students are able to seperate the clients needs from their wants and develop multiple solutions to that problem. Evaluating the final project and its viability is done from a purely objective standpoint.

Withholding the client's name and all other project details, the final solution after many meetings was proposing a website with an integrated app interface. While my team used traditional engineering methods such as weighted decision matrix, reading codes and standards, Gnatt chart project management, communication strategies were the most crucial to the success of the project. A tiered system of messaging was established:

* E-mail for communications to clients and "supervisor"  
* Facebook for regular communications  
* Text Messaging for urgent communications   
* Google Docs for meeting notes and action items  

As much as I would like to say it worked, poor leadership in assigning roles still lead to a lot of confusion during the projects' duration.
