A personal blog for Cardfight Vanguard.

<!-- more -->

Personally moved over from a wordpress website of the same name, I spent a fair amount of time migrating servers/pages/posts and modules. However, it was worth doing as it:

* allowed me the freedom to use js and css to customize the website
* provided cleaner management of images
* had no vulnerability as the website was static (not in php)
* less overhead altogether (no unecessary analytics tools or ads)

The blog has been on haitus since July 2016, due to increasing dissatisfaction with game direction.
