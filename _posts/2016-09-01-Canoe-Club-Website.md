Skule website for the University of Toronto Concrete Canoe club.

<!-- more -->

#### Project Aim

Website for delivering:

* Sponsorship package to potential sponsors  
* Displaying the club's current sponsors  
* Production/Meeting dates for general members  
* General overview of club activities for general interest  

#### Approach

After meetings with the project manager and previous website maintainer, Jekyll was chosen for the following reasons:

* Sucessful implementation of Jekyll with other clubs using the \*.skule.ca domain
* Static website minimizes complexity when transitioning between club webmasters
* The club does not have a large amount of data to serve, models and other administrative information is handled seperately.

#### Results

Website was deployed early October in time for the next round of sponsorships. The club website was able to be promoted along with the standard sponsorship package. Four new sponsors provided funding to the club for the following year.

The website was turned over to a new webmaster on September 2016, and has not had any major revamp at the time of this writing.
