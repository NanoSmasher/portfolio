Examining origin and cause of failure of a plastic chair back.

<!-- more -->

#### Project Aim

Performing an investigation of the origin and cause of failure of a plastic chair back.

#### Approach

The following material analysis was available:

*  Statement from the witness
*  Photographs of plastic chair
*  Reports of visual inspection
*  Optical Stereomicroscopy on failed and exemplar chair
*  Tensile Tests on failed and exemplar chair
*  Dimensional Measurements of crack
*  Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) on failed and exemplar chair
*  Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) on failed and exemplar chair
*  Thermoplastic Ash Content on failed and exemplar chair

In addition, standards on chair performance and material performance were collected.

A fishbone diagram of possible causes of failure was developed prior to investigation. The report used a Failure-Mode Contributing Factor Analysis (FMCFA) approach to reduce bias and to encompass all the factors that could contribute to the failure of the platic chair back.

Visual Inspection of the crack, along with the tensile test results of the failed chair, provided strong evidence to the cause of the failure. Other tests support the conclusion.
