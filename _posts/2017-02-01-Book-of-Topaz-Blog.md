A blog to show off neat websites/services.

<!-- more -->

After programming for several years and finding useful programs to optimize my work, I made a blog to talk about the various services I used.

Check out the blog at [nanosmasher.github.io/book-of-topaz](https://nanosmasher.github.io/book-of-topaz/)

Source code for the project is available on github: [https://github.com/NanoSmasher/book-of-topaz](https://github.com/NanoSmasher/book-of-topaz)
