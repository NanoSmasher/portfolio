Failure analysis of Sayano-Shushenskaya hydro power plant.

<!-- more -->

#### Project Aim
The Sayano-Shushenskaya Hydroelectric Power Station (SSH) is the largest power plant in Russia, but on August 17, 2009 suffered a major incident. This incident was analyzed from a process safety management (PSM) prospective to determine cause and prevention mechanisms to prevent similar disasters.

#### Approach

After reviewing past plant incidents, construction and operation history, an incident narrative was developed to describe the sequence of events that lead to the power plant failure and it's resulting consequences. Operation parameters considered include turbine maintainence logs, control setpoints, shutdown triggers, and human factors.

A sequence of events was developed, revealing key decisions in poor management, turbine design flaws, and improper operation safety. This is paired with a Fault Tree Analysis, and Event Tree Analysis, provides an overview on where different levels of process safety can be interested.

The following process safety management assessment details solutions to avoid future incidents using all of the four pillars of PSM.

* Pillar 1 - Process Safety Leadership  
* Pillar 2 - Understanding Process Hazards and Risks  
* Pillar 3 - Managing Risk  
* Pillar 4 - Review and Improvement  

A lessons learned document summarized the failed actions in part of the SSH staff and management followed by some recommended PSM improvements for the SSH as well as other Power Plants, especially those connected to an external Dispatching/Control Center.
