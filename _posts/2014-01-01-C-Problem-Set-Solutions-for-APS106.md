Solution to APS106 problem set in C.

<!-- more -->

My solutions for the C problem sets given in APS106, hosted on Github.

Through testing multiple methods of version-control software, I settled on Git due to its popularity and a large community focused on open source/leisurely licensed programs (Github). After testing Github for Windows, Smartgit, and a few other programs, the git command line ended up the most useful.

I found the computer engineer students in later years are taught what most companies prefer (client-server models like Subversion), much to my dismay...however I did recrete the then famous 2048 game for the rest of the engineering students to toil away at.

Source code for the project is available on github:
