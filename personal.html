Currently in my free time I am working on editing public community-driven wikis and assisting with datamined data in games. I do my share of static page content, developing and maintaining several pages and categories, but lately I've been working more and more on databases and modules. Some wikis store information using an extension called Cargo/CargoTables, which provides users with the ability to apply basic SQL queries and applies it various display formats: lists, tables, pie charts, and custom templates.
</p>

<p>
Basic as the queries are Cargo helps immensly as it aggregates data and automates many pages reducing the likelihood of contributor errors. This can be combined with Scribunto to provide useful summaries such as the example <a href="https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Ship_Drop_Table">Ship Drop Table</a> article on the AzurLane wiki. It provides a breakdown of all available character pages in the game that have been created by other users. Instead of modifying a value on that specific hero page and all other pages where that same information could be found, Cargo handles the rest of the pages to refer back to that one value. I work with Cargo, and by extension the Scribunto Lua scripting language, to reduce workload on other wiki editors. I like working with data and display data in a very pretty format so that why I use Cargo.

<p>
I used to play chess intensively and did hit 1800 ELO on a couple of online game boards at my peak, however these days I only browse news on what's happening with chess and daily puzzles. I have volunteered at a couple of schools to help teachers in supervise groups of children in early chess learning programs, and had a great time representing my high school to become the top chess team in the North Division for 2-3 years and region champion for 1-2 years.

<p>
Sports I practice regularly when available are tennis (during summer to fall season) and curling (winter to spring season).
</p>

<p>
In terms of gaming I practice a lot fighting games. This includes traditional style like Ultra Street Fighter 4, tag team style like Dragonball FighterZ, Airdashers like Under Night In Birth: EXE Late[st], obscure games like Touhou Hisoutensoku, and even platformers like Super Smash Brothers Melee <strike>for the Nintendo Gamecube</strike>. I am semi-active in the various scenes, but with a habit of changing names and alias a fair bit from tournament to tournament. I was a Tournament Organizer for UofT for a couple years setting up gaming stations, running brackets, and managing streams and advertisement.
